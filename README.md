# BASIC_ALGORITHM_PROJECT

This project consist of 7 problems on basic algorithm 

PROBLEM 1: 
  Calculate the square root of an integer
  
PROBLEM 2: 
  Search in a Rotated Sorted Array
  This task searhes for a given target in a rotated array with O(log(n)) time complexity 
  
  
PROBLEM 3: 
RE-arrange Array Digit 
Rearrange Array Elements so as to form two number such that their sum is maximum without any sorting function that Python provides 
The expected time complexity is O(nlog(n))

PROBLEM 4: 
Dutch National Flag Problem
Given an input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2, sort the array in a single traversal without using sorting function that Python provides.

PROBLEM 5: 
Autocomplete with Tries
Implement Trie autocomplete 

PROBLEM 6: 
Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
This look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. The code run in O(n) time without using Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.


PROBLEM 7: 
HTTPRouter using a Trie
For this exercise I implemented an HTTPRouter like you would find in a typical web server using the Trie data structure
