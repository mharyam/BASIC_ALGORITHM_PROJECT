# Explanation for each question 

1) Problem 1: square root of an integer:
    I used a dictionary as my data structure to get and set values
    The Time complexity is  O(n) because I traversed the range of the list to get the square of the number
    The space complexity is 0(1) 
   

2) Problem 2: Search in a Rotated Sorted Array:
   I am searching base on half of the record, after first getting the mid 
   I check if the mid is the pivot, then I search base on it 
   Since I am searching half the array Time Complexity is 0(log(n))
   The space complexity is 0(log(n))
   

3) Problem 3: Rearrange Array Digit:
   The time complexity is 0(log(n)) because I didn't traverse through all the list 
   The space complexity is 0(log(n))
 
   

4) Problem 4: Dutch National Flag:
    I made a single traversal 
    The worst case is  O(n) 
    The space complexity is 0(n)

   

5)Problem 5: Autocomplete with Tries:
    The Time complexity is O(log(n)) 
    The space complexity is 0(n)


6) Problem 6 Max and Min in a Unsorted Array:
    The worst case is 0(n), because I am traversing through the integer range 
    The space complexity is 0(n)
   

7) Problem 7: HTTPRouter using a Trie:
    The Time complexity is O(log(n)) 
    The space complexity is 0(n)
